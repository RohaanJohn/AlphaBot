ChadBot is a discord bot which is maintly built as a way to interact with APIs from discord. Currently it uses zenquote api to send a quote and api-ninjas api to send a fact to a channel every 1 hour. 


The command to send a random quote is -inspire and -help shows the other commands of the bot. 


The bot also responds to certain words like sad, unhappy, etc. with custom user inputted encouraging words.
Use -list to show all the added encouraging words, -add *the encouraging word* to add a new word to the list and -delete *position* to delete a word from the list.
If you want to turn off autoresponse from the bot use -responding off or use -responding on to turn autoresponse back on.
